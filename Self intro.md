### Self introduction
##### Shortcut
My name is Stas. I studied at *Vitebsk State Technological University (VSTU)*.  
I started to be interested in programming when I was a child, about 14 y.o. The first of all I begin learn *HTML + CSS* and created the   
couple of pretty simple websites with animations and transitions.
My first language of programming was Java. I learned some libraries like *JavaFX* for UI like and *Spring* for REST API implementation. 
After that I lean many languages and technologies like *Vue.js, React.js, C/C++/C#*. I was looking for myself.

##### Python and Django
Then I meet Python. And away we go. I started to lean it everywhere, tried some new technologies and apply a couple of Python principles. 
There is good community of Python and there was not a second when i could not find the answer to my question in the article, book or video tutorial.
I leaned Telegram and VK APIs and wrote some bots for this social networks using pyTelegramBotApi and aiogram. 
Also I made some parsers with requests/selenium, games with pygame. At this time I started learning technologies 
for web development like Django. It's the best framework what I have met. Now I have strong experience with it and DjangoREST. So, I have more 
than 2 years of experience of Python develompent. I have experience with relation databases like PostreSQL and MySQL, I actively use 
docker because I need to execute my developments on laptop with Linux Manjaro and home PC with Windows. 

##### What is next?
I'am improving my skills in different spheres like Machine Learning and non-relational databases like MongoDB. The next things what I want to learn 
is the others web frameworks like FastAPI and Bottle. Usually, I am ready to learn something new with great interest.
