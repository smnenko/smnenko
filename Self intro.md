### Self introduction
##### Shortcut
My name is Stas. I'm studying at *Vitebsk State Technological University (VSTU)*.  
I started to be interested in programming when I was a 14 y.o. The first of all I begin to learn *HTML + CSS* and created the   
couple of pretty simple websites with animations and transitions.
My first language of programming was Java. I learned some libraries like *JavaFX* for UI and *Spring* for implementation of REST API. 
After that I learned many languages and technologies like *Vue.js, React.js, C/C++/C#*. I was looking for myself.

##### Python and Django
Then I meet Python. And away we go. I tried some new technologies and implement a couple of Python principles. 
There's good community of Python and there wasn't a second when I couldn't find the answer to my question in the article, book or video tutorial.
I leaned Telegram and VK APIs and wrote some bots for it using pyTelegramBotApi and aiogram. 
Also I made some parsers with requests/selenium, games with pygame. I think you know I learned Django. This is the web framework that will facilitate development process. It has his own structure. It means that is's very simple to read but inefficient for small projects.  
Now I've strong experience with Django and DjangoREST. So I've more than 2 years of experience of Python develompent. I've experience with relation databases like PostreSQL and MySQL, I actively use docker because I need to execute my developments on laptop with Linux Manjaro and home PC with Windows. 

##### What is next?
I'm improving my skills in different spheres like Machine Learning and non-relational databases like MongoDB. The next things what I want to learn 
is the others web frameworks like FastAPI and Bottle. Usually, I'm ready to learn something new with great interest.
