### Self Introduction  
My name is Stanislav. I'm a Software Engineer with 3 years of experience mostly focused on back-end development. 
I’ve been developing large and scalable web-applications with Python programming language. My responsibilities include almost all aspects of backend development like infrastructure, data storage and REST API.
I have hands-on experience with Django, DjangoREST and Flask and in other python libraries and frameworks such as FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, PeeWee and many others. I also have knowledge of managing SQL-databases and asynchronous programming. I’ve worked with the front-end side of web-development via Vue and React, tools and technologies like Docker, Docker Compose and Jenkins.
My passion is refactoring legacy-code and following best programming principles. As for my personal qualities, I am a responsible and very driven developer. Also, it is always a joy for me to learn something new, deconstruct and implement it into practical cases. And a lot of people I know notice my quick adaptiveness and ability to learn new stuff quite fast. That’s all about me. If you have any questions I’ll be happy to answer any of them.
### Last Project
My last project was fully scoped within the advertising  domain with a customer from the United States. 
The app was designed to help advertising  organizations and customers to communicate with each other , build business relations and make more profit together. 
The tech stack included Python, Django, PostgreSQL as a database management system. Also, the significant role was played  by Celery with their tasks scheduler. Basically, the whole system was deployed with AWS services like Lambda, EC2 and S3. The team process was built around  Kanban which is a child of the Agile methodology family.   
I was involved in developing new features and refactoring the existing code. I took care of the database query optimization,  code readability and scalability. 
I dealt with the whole team, which was made up of 6 team members. There were 3 back-end, 2 front-end and 1 quality assurance engineer. 
The project had been running for 1 year and a half when I joined it. And it was an amazing time when I gained  most of my hands-on experience in  this domain and I improved my hard skills very fast.
### Duties and Responsibilities
1) I’m responsible for designing and implementing REST API endpoints using the Python programming language.
2) My duties are based  on coding principles like: writing understandable, scalable and efficient code, following SOLID and OOP basics, studying new hard skills and so on. 
3) Moreover, I have to  help my mentor with small&medium tasks involving  developing and improving the back-end side of his project. I understand that I have to improve my skills in all  development aspects each day. For example, I read “Grokking Algorithms - The Book '' last month  and I learned so much about graphs, sorting and filtering algorithms. It was an amazing experience, because the book was very understandable and readable. So, It’s hard to find similar books nowadays. Now I’m reading a new one called “Clean code” by Robert C. Martin and developing an asynchronous web-application using FastAPI and SQLalchemy libraries.
4) I spend most of my working time contributing to code quality through unit testing, integration testing, code review, and system design using Python.
5) I am involved in developing backend components to enhance performance and receptiveness, server-side logic, and platform, statistical learning models, and highly responsive web-applications.
6) I take care of data protection.
7) I mainly focus on designing and implementing low-latency, high-availability, and performant applications.
8) I’m involved in enhancing the functionalities of current software systems.
9) I’m in charge of integrating data storage solutions.
10) I have to test and debug programs.
### My biggest challenge
I was working on a project that hadn’t been  released then yet. The app was designed to help advertising  organizations and customers to communicate with each other , build business relations and make more profit together. During our sprints we began to notice that our application was too slow and  could barely provide  comfortable work for  5 active users. It was a big problem, because our system was expected to  handle least 1000 users at the same time.
One challenge I had was non optimized database queries. I mean queries in a loop, unreasonable joins and absence of caching. Another one challenge was a small number  of database workers. Our servers could support more workers than they used.
I found it difficult to research the whole project to catch all non optimized queries, but I did it. I also did some small fixes in our project configuration file and I raised the workers count/number Another team member added caching to all highly loaded parts of our application. 
The result was amazing. The Database was under 100% load capacity,  l and the response speed decreased by at least 40%. It was hard work, but we got extremely positive feedback throughout the whole process.
