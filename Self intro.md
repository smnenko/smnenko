My name is Stas. I’m a Software Engineer mostly focused on backend development. Also, I have experience with frontend. I started to be interested in programming when I was 14 y.o. At first, I began to study HTML + CSS and I created a couple of pretty simple websites with animations and transitions. My first language of programming was Java. I learned some libraries like JavaFX for UI and Spring for implementation of REST API. After that, I learned many languages and technologies like Vue.js, React.js, C/C++/C#. I was looking for myself. Then I meet Python. I tried some new technologies and implement a couple of Python principles. There's a good community of Python developers and there wasn't a second when I couldn't find the answer to my issue in the article, book, or video tutorial.
Today I have a lot of experience with Django and DjangoREST. During my work experience, I have used different relational databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL. Also, I have experience with React and Vue.js from the frontend side.
Now I focused on improving my skills in different spheres like Machine Learning and non-relational databases like MongoDB. The next thing I want to learn is the others web frameworks like FastAPI and Bottle. In my opinion, this knowledge will be useful to me for my professional development. 
As for my personal qualities, I am a responsible and very driven developer. Also, it is always a joy for me to learn something new, deconstruct and implement it into practical cases. And a lot of people I know notice my quick adaptiveness and ability to learn new stuff quite fast. That’s all about me. Do you have any questions?

Project
The main goal of the project was to create a set of applications that provide functionality for various parties involved in music production. For example singers, poets, composers, managers. The main features are writing and buying lyrics, writing and buying beats, singing, creating the preproduction tracks, EP’s and albums, selling songs via Spotify, iTunes, YouTube, managing all the processes related to music production, including the contracts, sharing profits between several parties.
As for infrastructure, there was a project with a small team of about 10 people. From our side, we have 6 team members (3 BE, 2 FE, and 1 QA). I had various responsibilities on that project like implementation different solutions, improve code quality and also refactor legacy code.
